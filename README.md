# Minetest Game - development version
This is a fork of the original minetest game. We have forked this due to the feature freeze of the original game.    
Most mods written for the minetest game should be compatible with this fork. If you find anything broken, there is an issue tracker.  



## Installation

- Unzip the archive, rename the folder to minetest_game_dev and
place it in .. minetest/games/

- GNU/Linux: If you use a system-wide installation place
    it in ~/.minetest/games/.

The Minetest engine can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/minetest/minetest).

## Compatibility

This fork should be compatible with the latest version of minetest. This fork assumes latest version and is generally a rolling release. however, on the next stable release, we tag the head so you can get a stable build for sure.
